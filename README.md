# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. 

## Key Questions and Objectives 
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer: 

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain? 
- What was the average rental duration for all videos? 
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? 
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value-based? 
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions? 

## Data Set
Data set was provided by Career Foundry. Data set contained information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, payments, rental history, and much more. This data set was loaded into the PostgreSQL database where quieries were written to extract the requiered data to answer the key questions. 

## Project Deliverables 
The results of this analysis was complied into an easily digestible format, which was presented to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.
